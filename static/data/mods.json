    "description": "Nanocomposites take the principal of aggressive drone swarms and condenses it to a single round, coherent beam, or blade edge. For a kinetic projectile, a number of autonomous nanite maniples are packed into a shaped CONSUME/HIVE round that shatters on positive target impact. On impact (or airburst/ penetration detonation) the maniples are released and begin to eat away at surrounding tissue or superstructure. They proceed until maniple burnout or total target consumption, whichever occurs first. In flight, the maniples are able to hive-link and adjust their round’s flight somewhat to ensure positive impact — coherent beams and edged weapons operate in a similar manner."

The first incident was recorded when paracausal ammunition was pushed to frontline soldiers during the Tian Shen civil engagements. It arrived in sealed magazines with directions to be loaded and fired as normal. There was to be no inspection of the magazines' contents, as this would “damage the payload” — frontline reports indicate that this ammunition impacts as normal on intended targets, though it seems to pierce armor and shielding at near-100% efficacy. Samples of paracausal ammunition have been flagged by Union for retrieval, and due to its development Harrison Armory is currently undergoing investigation by the Bureau; paracausal ammunition is still in use in the field, however, as shipments continue to leak to interested parties. HORUS is suspected, and a concurrent investigation is underway."

    "description": "Phase-Ready ammunition, as first described after its incorporation into the civil hostilities on Luna de Oro, is the “devil‘s round“: each round contains a nanoprocessor suite networked with its firing weapon that, ideally, calculates and translates the specific nature of that round‘s superpositional relation with its doppelgänger in the immediate space before its intended target. To wit, Phase Ready ammunition, when fired, exists in two places at once: exiting the barrel of the weapon it was fired from, and at the moment of impact into its target. The prime round may never hit its target, but as it already exists at the moment of impact, its doppelgänger round will hit its target. The fuzzy nature of such spooky action occurs in a way not fully understood save for in the faltering explanations of Harrison Armory‘s NHP Think Tank; as such, the action is not perfect, but falls within acceptable parameters for licensed production."
