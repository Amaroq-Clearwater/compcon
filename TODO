Alpha 1.5:
  ☐ Catalog
  ☐ Weapon Mods

Todo:
  ☐ Organize CSS
  ☐ Error handling for every find() (refactor)
  ☐ Utility function (where()?)
  ☐ Handlebars:partial the weapon template for ults and systems
  ☐ Put hardcoded stuff (eg. structure points) in external config json for easier updates/modding
  ☐ Clean up names
  ☐ Partialize player table items
  ☐ Move handlebars helper to own file and load on start
  ☐ Local Fonts
  ☐ require-handlebars-plugin to break out hbs files
  ☐ refactor taghelper
  ☐ remove tag arrays and use tag syntax in a "tags" string in the json
  ☐ parse effects and descriptions for damage words
  ☐ add apoc rail mount for barbarossa on config creation
  ☐ refactor chart builder
  ☐ set config status unavailable on JSON update if pilot is missing licenses
  ☐ collapse pilot_armor/weapons/gear jsons into single pilot_gear, differentiate by type
  ☐ weapon threat calc
  ☐ flex mounts
  ☐ CORE mounts
  ☐ for damage-by-range chart, seperate out melee and threat X (break w/ NaN) at the front of the chart
  ☐ inaccurate/accurate etc. should modify average damage

Bugs:
  ☐ Damage by Range isn't adding numbers correctly
  ☐ Locked licenses captured by a lower license number: eg. LL2 is hiding requirement for LL3.

Reminders:
  ☐ cb_hardpoints should be applied like a mod
  ☐ cb_burnout should be applied like a mod
  ☐ cb_neurolinked should be applied like a mod to all equipped weapons
  ☐ cb_ammofeeds should be applied like a mod to all limited systems
  ☐ tal_monkey rank 3 should be applied like a mod to all limited systems
  ☐ tal_eng should add a custom weapon
  ☐ tal_techno rank 2 should add a system
  ☐ HA Assault Launcher gets a free grenade or mine
  ☐ technophile confers 0sp custom NHP system
  ☐ custom background option
  ☐ personalizations adds +2 hp to mech

Ideas:
  ☐ Find a better solution for mech pics. Look stale atm.
  ☐ color scheme for pilots/mechs
  ☐ color schemes based off of manufacturer
  ☐ Custom notes/descriptions for items
  ☐ on print: traverse pilot data structure to get all possible power cards
  ☐ on print: update regular action cards with player/shell bonuses
  ☐ range/threat pips for weapons/systems
  ☐ rename weapons/gear; set custom descriptions instead of notes
  ☐ override eg. signature weapons to create custom versions at player creation
