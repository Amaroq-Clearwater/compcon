Ideas:
  ☐ color scheme for pilots/mechs
  ☐ color schemes based off of licenses
  ☐ Custom notes/descriptions for items
  ☐ on print: traverse pilot data structure to get all possible power cards
  ☐ on print: update regular action cards with player/shell bonuses
  ☐ range/threat pips for weapons/systems
  ☐ rename weapons/gear; set custom descriptions instead of notes
  ☐ override eg. signature weapons to create custom versions at player creation
