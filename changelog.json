    "date": "June 3rd, 2019",
    "version": "1.3.1",
    "body": "<p>Hello everyone!<br> Sorry about the delay – there’s a lot going on behind the scenes, but still, the wait can be frustrating. We’ve just finished up the final part of a massive refactor of the COMP/CON codebase, which should make things more stable and much easier to improve on. There won’t be too much different about this version for you, the end user, but:</p> <ul> <li><strong>COMP/CON data has been updated to the LANCER Core book pre-release v2</strong></li> <li>It is now possible to save pilots to the cloud (check the export and import options on the pilot roster)</li> <li>Likewise, you can toggle custom pilot and mech images to be stored in the cloud</li> </ul><br><p>There have been a few various bugfixes, tweaks, and quality-of-life improvements as well. Two things I need to note here:<br> This update changes the saved pilot data format. COMP/CON will attempt to convert your old pilots into the new format. If it can’t, it’ll save a copy of your old pilots into a <b>pilots.old</b> file in your <b>%APPDATA%</b> folder. If this happens, ping me (@beeftime) on the LANCER Discord and I’ll take a look.<br> Additionally, pilot <strong>Contacts</strong> have been (temporarily) removed from the pilot sheet. They’ll be reincorporated as part of a larger “Downtime Resources” module coming soon. If you’re currently using the contacts section for a LANCER game, save a copy of that information.<br> Also, forgive the lack of styling here and elsewhere – COMP/CON will be undergoing a styling pass before the official LANCER release to bring it more in-line with the design of the finished book. Once that’s done, work can begin in earnest on <strong>Android and iOS COMP/CON apps</strong></p> <p>Finally, a few thanks:<br> <strong>CommanderTso</strong> AKA build process real good right now AKA mr to damn devops has officially joined the COMP/CON dev team, and continues to make my life a lot easier.<br> <strong>Oscine, witchy, twillacy, ak318, Carnival, johnbehr, Gibbay, Alaska, Radio Protector, Zieche, BrokenFocus</strong> for being my volunteer testing/bodyslam crew, as well as everyone who hangs around the #comp-con channel.</p>"
