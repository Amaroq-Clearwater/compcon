A cigar chomping, kleptomaniac, compulsive liar, Cio is known for her overbearing personality and a tendency to speak in a confusing dialect known as the Black Speech. Cio is rather particular about storytelling. <br>Cio has a rather abrasive, overbearing personality. She is very easy to rile up, and she will be quick to cuss people out in her crankier moods. She is also notably impatient, unscrupulous, cowardly and a habitual liar, but she can be surprisingly calm and mature in serious situations. She exhibits most typical personality traits of blue devils.",
