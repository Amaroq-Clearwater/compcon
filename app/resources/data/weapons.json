    "description": "The HA Krakatoa was developed specifically for the Hercynian crisis, as chassis-size flamethrowers had been deemed unnecessary, and more to the point, banned by anti-terror conventions. With the combination of thick arboreal environment, swarm tactics of the Egregorians, and ineffectual performance of slug ammunition, the need for a recession on the ban was apparent. The Krakatoa was quickly developed and affiliate patterns disseminated. Adopted by Union MEF units, the Krakatoa saw heavy use in the deep world-jungle of Hercynia and towering hives of the Egregorians thanks to its stability, intensity, and stopping power — a necessary feature competitor makes lacked. Egregorian drones and warriors, commanded by their overminds, would not stop advancing until they were physically incapable of doing so — the force at which the Krakatoa expelled flame and fuel was sufficient to knock back or otherwise incapacitate charging warriors on the periphery of the flame cone. Reworked after the cessation of the Hercynian crisis, the Krakatoa is now a popular tool for creating area-of-denial firebreaks. It’s legality is currently under review by the Galactic Treaties Board."

Where the contents of that bubble go is unknown, but the effect is dramatic: anything inside the projected bubble simply ceases to exist in this dimension, transported somewhere else in the void of blinkspace. The Displacer makes no sound when fired, but the sudden and necessary venting of its power supply is tremendous; similarly, the heat wave of its backblast is deadly to any unshielded personnel exposed to it."

To call it a rifle, though, is shorthand: a laser rifle is a projector that utilizes a series of apertures and lenses to amplify and focus light into tight beam, visible in the right circumstances, that paints a target long enough to heat the area of “impact“ into plasma. The HA SOL-pattern laser rifle is capable of a 3.5PW maximum output, pulsed, but can project a beam at lower power levels; additionally, while some laser rifles can double as communication/data transfer devices, the Armory‘s SOL is strictly tuned for combat, and has no such communication capability. The SOL is a solid state and entirely self-contained, but can be patched into a chassis‘ reactor core for operation and to re-charge spent weaponry. Energy weapons, while having downsides of their own, are commonly used in micro-and-zero-gravity environments due to having no impulse or kinetic user feedback."

A tachyon accelerator projects tachyon particles -- essentially a subatomic localized object -- faster than light towards its target. These particles are impossible to see through optical/visible means: as they travel faster than light, they cannot be seen or avoided intentionally. Though the size of the particle is tiny, the sheer speed and energy of travel is titanic, and the damage a tachyon lance imparts on its target -- should it connect -- is unparalleled."

Firing an excited toroid of plasma, the Lash can be used as a ranged weapon with a delayed-detonation, or, essentially, a point-blank melee weapon; if used at point blank range, the toroid is detonated inside of its launcher, directing an intense thermal blast directly at its target."
