The BLACKBEARD license range is built for environments where combustible kinetic weaponry is either useless, too dangerous, or would prompt unnecessary collateral damage. Its distinctive, slim frame is a evocative of its speed and reduces its radar profile, making it hard to track and harder still to hit. The BLACKBEARD platform has been split into two model lines, the IPS-N/BB-L, which is the standard production line model, and the IPS-N/BB-Sk, a prototype limited print run of BB models purpose-built to contain IPS-N’s SEKHMET NHP platform.","size":1,"armor":1,"sp":5,"mounts":["Flex","Auxiliary","Heavy"],"stats":{"hull":2,"agi":1,"sys":-1,"eng":-1},"ult_name":"Assault Grapples","ult_description":"The IPS-N branded assault grappling system is a proven, class-leading system rated to handle hauling, supporting, and securing chassis up to Galactic Standard Size 4.
