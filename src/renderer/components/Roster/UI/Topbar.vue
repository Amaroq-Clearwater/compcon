              <p>
                The COMP/CON Pilot Roster is a repository for LANCER Player Characters ("Pilots") and their mechs.<br>
                Their mechs -- the combination of Frame and weapon/system loadout is referred to, in COMP/CON as a "Configuration".
              </p><p>
                <v-card class="elevation-3"><v-card-text>
                The sidebar lists all saved pilots. Clicking anywhere on the sidebar will expand it. 
                <br> 
                Clicking on a Pilot will load the Pilot Sheet, and expand the list of saved Configurations.
                <br> To add a new Configuration, click the <v-btn small depressed color="grey lighten-3" :ripple="false"><v-icon small color="black">add</v-icon>Add New Configuration</v-btn> button to be taken to the New Configuration Wizard.
                </v-card-text></v-card>
              </p><p>              
                You can add a new Pilot by clicking the <v-btn small depressed color="grey lighten-3" :ripple="false"><v-icon small color="black">add</v-icon>Add Pilot</v-btn> button, which will open the Add New Pilot wizard.

              <h1>Pilots</h1>
              <p>
                COMP/CON allows you to create, edit, save, export, and import Pilots for LANCER games.
                <br>
                This section details the Pilot Sheet, accessible by clicking the Pilot's Callsign or Avatar from the sidebar. Details on Pilot-specific game mechanics, or more information about how Pilot skills and attributes are referenced during gameplay, can be found in the <a flat color="primary" class="ma-0 pa-1" @click="open('https://massif-press.itch.io/lancer-core-book')">LANCER Core Book</a>
              </p>
              <h2>Pilot Sheet</h2>
                <v-expansion-panel class="ma-3">
                  <v-expansion-panel-content>
                    <template v-slot:header><h4>Identity and Stats</h4></template>
                    <v-card class="pa-2 pl-4">
                      <p>
                        The first section of the Pilot Sheet contains the Pilot's Callsign and Name, both of which can be edited by clicking the <v-icon small>edit</v-icon> button next to the field.
                        <br>
                        The right side of this section shows the Pilot's License Level. Clicking the <v-btn color="primary" icon small dark><v-icon class="pl-4">arrow_upwards</v-icon></v-btn> button will open the Pilot Level Wizard, which will walk you through the level-up process and automatically determine which bonuses the Pilot is eligible for. 
                        <br>
                        Clicking the <v-icon small>build</v-icon> icon below will open up the Level Edit tool, allowing you to set the Pilot's level anywhere from the current level to the maximum level (12). This tool shouldn't necessarily be used for Pilots currently being played in a LANCER game, but is very useful for build experimentation. Be aware that the Level Edit tool cannot be used to subtract Pilot levels. 
                      </p><p>
                        Below the Callsign is a row containing the current Pilot's combat-relevant stats: Health Points, Armor, Electronic Defense, Evasion and Speed. COMP/CON automatically calculates these values based on Pilot level and currently selected Gear Loadout       
                      </p>
                    </v-card>

                      <p>
                        The left side of this section contains the Pilot's Background (which can be changed by clicking on the <v-icon small>edit</v-icon> button). The background does not contribute any mechanical effects to the Pilot but is narritively important. Below that is a list of the Pilot's current Invocations. Per the rules, Pilots should have 4 Invocations (two Accuracies and two Difficulties), but you may enter more (or fewer) per GM discretion.
                      </p><p>
                        Below the Invocations is the Pilot History. This is not a required field, but is useful for keeping notes regarding your Pilot's origin and backstory.
                      </p><p>
                        Below the Pilot History is the Contacts section (Friends & Foes on the official LANCER Character Sheet). Contacts do not provide any direct mechanical effects, but is useful for character backstory and should be added to as your LANCER campaign progresses.
                      </p><p>
                        To the right side of this section is the Pilot portrait image, which can be changed by clicking on the <v-icon small>edit</v-icon> button in the section header. This will bring up an image selection modal. The first tab ("Pilot Portrait") is the image displayed on the Pilot Sheet, and works best with images around 1:1.5 or 1:2 width:height. The second tab ("Pilot Avatar") image is used as the Pilot's avatar icon in the left-hand sidebar.
                        <br>
                        Below the pilot image is an Appearance section which can be used to detail your Pilot's physical appearance instead of, or in addition to, the portrait image.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Grit, Skill Triggers, Licenses, Talents, and Mech Skills</h4>
                      <p>
                        GRIT is a calculated value and will advance as your Pilot levels up. It's automatically included in Pilot stat and Mech stat calculations.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Skill Triggers, Licenses, Talents, and Mech Skills can each be edited by clicking the <v-icon small>edit</v-icon> button in the respective section header. For Skill Triggers, Licenses, and Talents, you must click the "Save" button on the left panel to commit your changes to the Pilot Sheet. Mech Skills are updated automatically.

                        Pilots gain a CORE Bonus every 3 levels, and aside from GMS Bonuses, a Pilot must have at least 3 levels in a Manufacturer's license to unlock their CORE Bonuses. Please note that to take another Manufacturer-specific CORE Bonus, a Pilot must have an additional 3 levels (eg. taking two SSC CORE Bonuses would require 6 ranks of SSC Licenses, spread amongst any number of SSC Frames)

                        COMP/CON allows for the creation of Pilot and Mech "Loadouts": saved collections of equipment that can be swapped on the fly, ideal for saving favorite item combinations for various mission profiles.
                        </p><p>
                        To add an initial Pilot Gear Loadout, click the <v-btn color="primary" small dark><v-icon>add</v-icon> Add New Loadout</v-btn> button. Additional loadouts can be added by clicking the <v-icon small color="black">add</v-icon> icon on the loadout selection tab bar.
                        </p><p>
                        Each gear entry is composed of two parts: the left-side mount button (gear type, for Pilots), and the equipped item data. Clicking the mount button (either "Equip Armor/Weapon/Gear" or "Armor/Weapon/Gear" for an equipped slot) opens up the item table. For any table item, clicking on the item name will expand a card with additional information, and clicking the <v-btn color="primary" small dark>Equip</v-btn> button will assign that item to the selected slot.
                        </p><p>
                        Clicking the item name on the Pilot Sheet loadout will expand a card with additional item information. Clicking again will collapse it.

              <p>
                The upper-right side of the Pilot Sheet shows the Pilot's License Level. Clicking the <v-btn color="primary" icon small dark><v-icon class="pl-4">arrow_upwards</v-icon></v-btn> button will open the Pilot Level Wizard, which will walk you through the level-up process and automatically determine which bonuses the Pilot is eligible for. 
                <br>
                Clicking the <v-icon small>build</v-icon> icon below will open up the Level Edit tool, allowing you to set the Pilot's level anywhere from the current level to the maximum level (12). This tool shouldn't necessarily be used for Pilots currently being played in a LANCER game, but is very useful for build experimentation. Be aware that the Level Edit tool cannot be used to subtract Pilot levels.

              <h3>Pilot Level Wizard</h3>
              <p>
              This wizard will guide you through leveling up your LANCER Pilot, and will automatically determine what level bonuses your Pilot is eligible for.
              <br>
              Please note that added levels cannot be removed. If you're uncertain, make a backup of your Pilot, or clone them for theorycrafting and experimentation.

                      Every 3 levels (3, 6, 9, and 12) Pilots unlock a CORE Bonus -- a permanent, powerful enhancement that applies to every mech the Pilot operates.
                      <br>
                      GMS Core Bonuses are always available, but manufacturer-specific bonuses require 3 license levels (spread amongst any of that manufacturer's licenses) to unlock. For example: A player who wants to unlock SSC's Ghostweave CORE Bonus could take three license levels in the SSC BLACK WITCH, or two in the SSC DEATH'S HEAD and one in the SSC DUSK WING, or one license level in the SSC METALMARK, SSC MONARCH, and the SSC MOURNING CLOAK. To unlock <i>two</i> SSC CORE Bonuses, that pilot would need to have a total <b>6</b> levels in SSC licenses.
