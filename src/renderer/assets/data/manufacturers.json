    "id": "GMS",
    "name": "General Massive Systems",
    "description": "The oldest and most ubiquitous of the Big 5, General Massive Systems (GMS) is an all-purpose supplier to all persons in Union's hegemony. From mech chassis and ship hulls to casual clothing, from prefab space station bulkheads to coffee beans, GMS's catalogue reaches across a galaxy worth of goods, materials, and services. GMS is widely viewed as the reliable baseline of goods quality across the galaxy: anything worse than GMS quality is junk, anything better tends to be unique or luxury.<br>GMS began as an independent outfitter during the first expansion period that grew to ubiquity as the outward colonial push afforded by nearlight drives surged. Union saw value in controlling what was seen as the industry standard supplier, and nationalized GMS. The corporate entity became an arm of Union's ever expanding bureaucracy, a way to standardize equipment and consumables across the rapidly growing class of explorers, colonists, and scientists venturing out into the stars.<br>As colonial expansion continued and competitor corporations emerged onto the galactic supply, a baseline of equipment was needed in order to assess what improvements needed to be made to Cradle - specific gear; similarly, dramatic time dilation was far more of an obstacle in those early days than it is in the narrative present, and some standard, legacy - compatible equipment was needed in order to assure compliance across disparate eras.<br>Thus, with the incredible wealth of Cradle behind it, General Massive Systems became that ubiquitous supplier. Over thousands of years, it has grown to become a massive department of Union, and the standard against which all others are measured. GMS is an economic engine, one of a large toolbox, by which Union promotes their “brand” across the galaxy. Distinct from Union's political and military arms, GMS is an ever - present flexing of soft power: it is ubiquitous to the point of being the “normal” standard by which most all universal goods are judged by.<br>GMS, unlike the other entities listed in this section, does not engage in worldbuilding, colonial ventures, or expeditions--it sets the standard for which all others build from and supplies them with the gear they need. It creates the world of goods, services, equipment, and habitations most humans know to be “normal”. GMS's power comes from its ability to set what the galactic acceptable standard is: by nudging that bar ever up, it forces non-Union entities to develop alternatives that benefit humanity as a whole, even if they are developed for selfish, profit-driven motives.<br>GMS rarely reaches out to outside contractors for work. Its headquarters is on Cradle proper, like the rest of Union's Central Command, and it has offices throughout the inhabited galaxy."

    "id":"IPS-N",
    "name": "IPS-Northstar",
    "description": "The last and largest of the Triumvirate Corpros is Interplanetary Shipping-Northstar, or, IPS-N, a shipping and transport conglomerate that has been around since the discovery of nearlight and suspension protocols allowed for the first interstellar commerce. IPS-N formed as a mutual defense pact between Interplanetary Shipping, Inc, and the Northstar Corporation, two shipping giants plagued by environmental hazards and early orbital/suborbital piracy. Both IPS and Northstar trace their lineage back to Cradle, where they began initially as shipwright unions that organized the early engineers, mechanics, and laborers who reactivated the Theseus shipyard, an artifact of Old Humanity. Prior to the discovery of blinkspace and the construction of the first gates, piracy in Union space was not yet interstellar. Pirate MO was to strike in low orbit, emerging above their targets from satellite debris rings or on a wildcat-launch intercept trajectory from underneath, aiming to interdict shuttles as they load or unload their goods onto the waiting interstellar freighters. Pirates were largely orbital, small outfits that struck their targets with an aim to kill and salvage goods to fence planetside. Early low orbit piracy saw desperate teams of patchwork buccaneers pack onto shuttles loaded with bolted-on kinetic weapons -- formidable enemies for civilian merchant ships. In light of this danger, IPS and Northstar merged, combining their resources to create a private anti-piracy force in order to protect their investments. IPS-N, working with early Union Navy officers, developed the first ship-to-ship and anti-boarding doctrines, as well as the first purposebuilt point defense weapons. The introduction of blinkspace opened up new fields of trade, as well as new arenas of piracy. IPS-N continued to build out their fleets and security teams, now protecting whole trade corridors in exchange for percentages of all trade. This relationship has persisted over thousands of years, becoming so firmly ingrained in galactic practice that IPS-N is now a household name in many core and key colony worlds; IPS-N's early anti-piracy teams -- now often called by their nickname, The Albatross -- are often looked at as the de-facto peacekeeping force in many distal spreads of the galaxy. As trade grows and humanity's reach expands, so do does IPS-N. IPS-Northstar's home campus is located in Corespace, outside of Cradle in the Argo Navis system. Carina, the primary world of Argo Navis, is a bucolic world of warm, shallow seas, azure skies, and rolling plains of deep grass. A world of terrestrial and aquatic oceans, perfect for the stellar maritime CS. Carina is ringed by ten moons, two thick with habitable atmosphere — Pyxis and Vela. All are given over to research and development of IPS-N's interstellar ships and chassis, support systems, and temporal acclimation facilities for retiring Cosmopolitan members of IPS-N's antipiracy Albatross teams. 400 IPS-N, in addition to developing interstellar ships and legacy chassis, run a humanitarian mission, Northstar Realignment. Northstar Realignment is the top-flight temporal embassy and education center for Cosmopolitans returning from long-haul relativistic voyages. Beyond the Argo Navis system, IPS-N maintains numerous field offices and Cosmopolitan lounges on blink stations, meant to serve long-haul merchants and regular Cosmopolitans both. IPS-N field offices are the first-contact point for aspiring IPS-N engineers, mechanics, navigators, and pilots, as well as a common first-contact point for people looking to crew or rent a berth on an outbound interstellar ship. Players would commonly encounter IPS-N employees, officers, and personnel on blink stations, around uplift stations, and on space ports. Blink stations usually have an IPS-N Cosmopolitan Lounge or field office where players can get civilian updates on news, galactic happenings, and check travel reports. Of the Triumvirate, IPS-N remains the least diversified in terms of a catalogue of goods. Outside of milspec chassis, hulls, and equipment, IPS-N primarily sticks to interstellar-capable vessels, equipment, and gear, from the fleet-tier to the personal consumer. IPS-N is a sure bet for any interstellar travellers, with a thousands of years of banked goodwill boosting their brand."

    "id": "SSC",
    "name": "Smith-Shimano Corpro",
    "description": "Smith-Shimano Corpro is another of the Triumvirate Corpros, the smallest and most missionfocused of the three, with their physical territorial holdings dwarfed by their presence in the omninet and in Diasporan biologies. SSC came to prominence during the second expansion period, growing rapidly to dominate the Core market in Union's liberal, pre-RA transhumanist approach to biological and cybernetic enhancement. Following the Deimos Event, the RA Accords, and the ensuing crackdown on AI 397 generation and civilian ontologic/singularity-focused experimentation, SSC tacked to a more “natural” approach to biological and cybernetic human enhancement. Instead of pursuing marriage between human and artificial intelligences, they would focus on improving the bodies we lived in; instead of removing the need to step to the stars, they would make it so we could step to the stars. SSC's corporeal development pushes the edge of what it means to be a human being. Cybernetic enhancements, subdermal nettings, aurals, implanted neuroneutral omnihooks, ontologic bridges, co-subjectivity nodes, panacea glands -- the list is exhausting, and that only covers the Foreign Body department of SSC's massive R&D campus-worlds. The real bulk of SSC's cutting edge research comes in the form of their own citizens, a population of billions spread across a constellation of moons, worlds, stations, and habitats. These populations are monitored and cultivated to produce best-fit genetic material for SSC's big manna buyers: colony firms looking to license bespoke populations for as-yet-unexploited worlds. Smith-Shimano Corpro's home campus is an omnispace node address, a shared virtual space that collects a wide net of colony prospect words throughout the Sierra Madre line. It is shielded by layers of hyper-solipsistic, anticausal/paradox generation security coding, managed by NHPs seeded from proprietary divergent subjectivities — in short, it is difficult and dangerous to attempt to hack into. The campus itself is represented by a many-chambered estate, palatial, where the heads of representative genetic lines meet in virtual space. It appears to have no counterpart in realspace, though it is often suggested that the architectural inspiration for the estate comes from a building on Smith-Shimano's first colony world, Opal, long ago lost to bitter civil violence. Realspace Smith-Shimano campuses exist across the Sierra Madre line, serving roles akin to embassies on the Corpro-State's many territorial holdings. These embassies are upload points linked to the CS's private omninode. The worlds under SSC's direct control are, generally, small worlds -- atmospheric moons and arcadian worlds that are lightly developed, with tightly controlled populations that are purposebred in arranged couplings in order to create biome-specific lines of bespoke colony seed. The people on these worlds are aware of SSC's mission -- they are citizens of the corpro state, most invested in the same mission as their corporate masters. Save for a donation of genetic material (a few hairs, a drop of blood) and a cultural insistence on arranged coupling, life on a Constellation World is largely similar to that of life on a given non-SSC core world. SSC mounts expeditions into all sectors of space to seek out new and interesting genetic materials. Their recruitment materiel leans heavily on the benefits for immigrating to an SSC world: they are, in a phrase, your ideal paradise. SSC is also known for their luxury-forward consumer goods and machinery. Elegant ships, chassis, and hardsuits for the discerning Cosmopolitan and Diasporan alike. Fabrics and materials that feel perfect against your skin, cybernetic and biological enhancements that will never fail or be rejected by your body, flash-grown internals and extremities -- insurance, should 398 the worst happen. SSC's LUX line of consumer goods is bespoke down to the atom, crafted for the person who ordered that ship, chassis, suit, or bottle of wine. There's only one of you in the galaxy -- shouldn't there be only one of these? The average galactic citizen sees SSC as a luxury brand that emphasized attachment to the craft and expertise that creates the material world around them. SSC's advertisements emphasize the hand-crafted nature of their goods, the long-cycle growth of their biologicals -- to SSC's public face, printing is a necessary evil, one that can make the goods the masses need, but not the perfect, unique item you need. SSC's power comes from the licensing of these luxury goods, cybernetics, and biological lines. They do not cede control over their genestock to the colony firms that use them: in fact, they retain ultimate rights over them, as they rely on the risk of other corporations, states, and private groups to inject new and interesting mutations into their finely cultivated genelines."

    "id": "HORUS",
    "name": "HORUS",
    "description": "HORUS is unlike any other supplier worth noting on the galactic scale. Not a state and not a corporation, HORUS is best described as a decentralized, non-corporeal entity, an anoriginary affiliation of omninet personalities, memes, and subcode that release systems and gear via manifesto, event, and physical dead drop. This entity first rose to public knowledge following the Deimos Event, leading many who know of it to assume that it is a product of the Deimos Event -- eager cataloguers of HORUS history are quick to suggest that it is a branched-intelligence of RA, a sliver of the MONIST entity given to spreading itself among those who it deems worthy. However, other possibilities exist: that it is a blacksite Union project to track and identify rogue NHP programs or HORIZON sympathizers; a Union (or Triumvirate) R&D program that crowdsources results from blind field testing; the dream of an NHP in cascade, and its adherents the interpreters of that dream; an intrusive thread of a parallel universe, its reality bleeding into ours via a permanent rip in blinkspace; evidence of a true alien intelligence, generated memetically by the long-dead minds of the Union Far-Field team that first discovered HORUS's seed hieroglyphs. Many possibilities exist, and whole groups and movements are devoted towards discovering the true nature of HORUS. In the meantime, HORUS continues to release their unique pattern-groups to a select cadre of pilots, revealing nothing of its inner workings, history, or goals. HORUS's licensing process is atypical, involving an esoteric and inaccessible set of criteria that interested parties have yet to crack. Often appearing as a white rabbit series of clues, or as a persistent haunting, or as an otherwise routine status-synch when confirming a requisition, licensure from HORUS is a mixed bag to many pilots. Some wear it as a badge of honor, proud that their years of investigating the entity has paid off with a confirmation of its existence -- others keep it a closely guarded secret, both for the trouble it would cause them with their commanders and the rumor that HORUS licenses are only granted to a new pilot upon the previous licenseholder's corporeal death. Your average galactic citizen would have no knowledge of HORUS. Knowledge of its existence is restricted to high-clearance Union Intelligence Bureau officers and deep-omni hacker cadres. HORUS has no “official” representation -- occasionally one may see the wadjet stenciled onto an alley wall -- but this entity keeps no offices, stations, or worlds. There are no standing HORUS armies or fleets or security services. However, it is worth noting the existence of the metafold vaults. As best UIB agents can surmise, HORUS's metafold vaults appear to be a project similar to the Massif vaults on Cradle. Metafold vaults are physical/metaphysical locations, usually a heavily guarded, secret installation built into the interior of a centaur world, an asteroid or comet of sufficient size, or aboard a station seeded in the middle to lower atmospheres of a gas giant. Their locations are kept secret; in the narrative present, only two metafold vaults have been discovered 402 -- one by a UIB Advance Team, which folded in on itself and disappeared, and the other by an Albatross wing, who redirected the comet it was housed in into a nearby star. HORUS only makes systems, weapons, and protocols. It makes no consumer goods, and is unknown to all but a small percentage of the galaxy's population."

    "id": "HA",
    "name": "Harrison Armory",
    "description": "Harrison Armory is the premier weapons and weapon-platform manufacturer in the galaxy, one of the Triumvirate Corpros, a group of three massive, galaxy-spanning corpro states that dictate, to a degree, some of the galactic politics. The Armory, as it is known around Union's departments and bureaus, develops some of the most advanced conventional and paracausal tech that is legally distributed; next to GMS, the Armory is the second most common supplier for state fleets, militaries, and police forces. Their success can be credited in large part to their Special-Exception Persistent-Cultivation Legionspace Environment, SEPCLE or, colloquially, Think Tank. Think Tank is a choir of nearcascade NHP that the Armory uses for research and development into paracausal technology, forecasting, and department management. Due to the Armory's special relationship with Union, it is allowed to run a choir of NHP at critical levels of self-awareness; the Think Tank is a closely guarded secret in the Armory, one that only a select few people know the truth about. In addition to their weaponry and weapon platforms, the Armory is known for its sturdy exploration gear, consumer and state-level logistics and infrastructure packages, personal groundcars, and spirits. Harrison Armory is a big player in galactic trade, as their Distal Development program cultivates and exports exotic alien spices, flora, fauna, and minerals for consumer use. Harrison Armory is an aggressive, expansionist, colonio-corpro state power that works with Union to expand and develop humanity's presence across the stars. Their relationship with Union is one built on the expectation of distant future friction. For the time being, both entities can find more benefit working together than against one another, but as the Armory grows in directly administered territory and power, the more they find themselves a bigger and bigger bullet point on the Union Central Committee briefing materials. Harrison Armory's eponymous armory complex is located on Ras Shamra, the primary world orbiting Ptah's Star. Ras Shamra is a tide-locked world in the close band of its system's habitable zone: it is a world that balances on the knife-edge between extremes, as tidal locking means the world does not rotate. Habitable in the balanced, temperate zone of the world's terminator line, Ras Shamra's sun-facing side is locked in perpetual daylight, baked under punishing temperatures from Ptah's Star. On the side of the world that faces away from the sun, it is forever nighttime, the world locked in a perpetual deep winter night. A thin atmosphere covers the world, breathable, but outside the terminator line extreme temperatures and weather make it impossible for an unshielded human to survive. The Armory itself is a sprawling administrative, research-industrial arcology built in Ras Shamra's terminator line, a temperate band where the day and night side of Ras Shamra meet and mix. The Armory circles the planet, a city-campus that holds a population of nearly three hundred million employees, executives, and other personnel inside of its walls. A number of perpetual hyperloop rings band the planet, providing rapid transit through the Armory, and a single, artificial river-sea meanders through the whole of the arcology, fed by natural springs and imported glacier-cuts from the night side of the world. Ras Shamra is a difficult world to live on, and the Armory takes it as a point of pride that they've manage to tame enough of it to call it their home. The day and night sides of Ras Shamra act as proving grounds for Harrison Armory chassis, weapons, and strike/acquisition teams. HA/AT troopers often mark their kits with “unofficial” honors for having proven themselves in both the day and night advanced training courses, setting themselves apart from green hires who enlist to advance their corporate political career. Ras Shamra is encircled by concentric rings of orbital defense stations and shipyards where a population around a hundred million permanent residents reside and work. Here the great paracausal and supermassive weaponry of the Armory is built, tested, and stored. The work in the rings is constant, and HA hulls of all classifications are churned out at a rate that, while not rivaling IPS-N, is approaching comparable. The location of Harrison Armory's Forecast/GALSIM-NHP analogue, the Think Tank, is kept secret, though presumed to be buried deep below the frozen tundra of Ras Shamra's night side. Think Tank, while a closely guarded corpro secret, is known to Union, which enjoys regular inspections of the facility -- this is a thorn in the side of Harrison Armory's Director General, who would prefer that Union keep their prying eyes from sensitive corporate technology. The general public on a core world -- a good measure of what amounts to “public galactic knowledge” -- would not have any knowledge of the particulars of Ras Shamra, Think Tank, or the particular operations of a Harrison Armory Acquisition Team. They would know Harrison Armory as a weapons manufacturer and defense contractor, whose name they hear in snippets of newscasts discussing Cradle politics, distal colonial affairs, and mentioned in contrast to IPSN's stranglehold on interstellar shipping."
