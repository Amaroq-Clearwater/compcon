    "description": "The SHERMAN is Harrison Armory‘s line-model chassis: any station, nation, world, stellar, or interstellar state that holds a fleet-tier contract with Harrison Armory fields a backbone force of localized SHERMAN cores. The SHERMAN platform is tuned to provide a rugged, versatile power plant for HA‘s fleet-line energy weaponry and a heat-dispersal system to ensure that the tremendous power requirements do not overwhelm the chassis‘ tolerance. Next to GMS‘s EVEREST, the SHERMAN is the second most-common mech chassis in the core systems, so much so that GMS has recently made a push to include more ablative and wave-scatter defenses into its stock +1 models to deal with hostile actors fielding the SHERMAN.",
